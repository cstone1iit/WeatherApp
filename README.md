# WeatherApp
# This was a project in CS442 Mobile App Development at The Illinois Institute of Technology.
# This app pulls JSON data from a weather API to show real time weather on the app. Recycler views are used for a 48 hour weather view and a 7 day forecast in a seperate activity. The units can be toggled between Imperial and Metric via a menu item. The location of the weather can be changed through a menu item prompting the location with an alert dialog - geocoding is used to obtain the correct location format for the API call.
